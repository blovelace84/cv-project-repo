    <p>Hello, My name is Brittani Lovelace. I am currently an employee at Amazon Fullfillment center, located in Garner, North Carolina.<br>
    I have been an employee at Amazon for going on 4 years, which is a long time being working in the warehouse industry. <br>
    Although, I enjoy working in this industry, I have decided to take the next step in my journey to pursue a career in tech. <br>
    This is a step that I am proud of taking in my life. <br> I am attending Springboard to pursue a career in Software Development. <br>
    I chose this career path because I enjoy making website using HTML and CSS. <br> I have previous experience in both HTML and CSS <br>
    and I am sharing this experience with you. Come along and join me on my journey by getting to know me through this website and feel free to connect with me <br>
 through linkedin. Looking forward to taking on along for the ride.</p>
